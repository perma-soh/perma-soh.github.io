								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/positive.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>The PERMA model is a positive psychology model created by Martin Seligman aimed to help well-being and happiness. Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Achievements are the 5 key elements that can help people live a fullining, happy, and meaningful life. The goal is to think of each of these components as buckets and that in order to be at your best, there must be something in each of these buckets. We have outlined definitions for each of these areas and come up with ways that college students can be aware of and incorporate these into their own lives.</p>

						<!-- Positive Emotions -->
							<article id="positive">
								<h2 class="major">Positive Emotions</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/positive.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3 class="minor">Definition/Importance</h3>
								<p>Positive emotions are most associated with the term “happiness.” Being able to focus more on the positive side of things and remain optimistic about certain future outcomes have proven to have many benefits. Things such as having more satisfying relationships, more perseverance, and less anxiety when adjusting to life tasks just to name a few. Using a positive scope helps us to distinguish the difference between pleasure and enjoyment. Pleasure is when a basic life necessity such as hunger or sleep is satisfied. Enjoyment is when creativity and intellectual stimulation are used to complete a task such as finishing a hard puzzle.</p>
								<h3 class="minor">Helpful Tips for College Students</h3>
								<p>College is a very unique situation that puts its students in a very stressful and challenging environment. Trouble finding time to yourself, trying to have a social/romantic life while also balancing a full class load and a job is a common theme for college students. Being able to focus on the things that are going right in your life (maybe a good grade on a test, a raise at work, or a date went well) rather than the things that might be stressing you out can help you not only balance your life, but actually help you thrive in any type of environment. Some other ways to focus on positivity is to focus on things you are grateful for throughout your daily life, to practice being present/mindful, and to be kind to others.</p>

						<!-- Engagement -->
							<article id="engage">
								<h2 class="major">Engagement</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/engage.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3 class="minor">Definition/Importance</h3>
								<p>Engagement is the area that deals with activities that elevate your well-being by providing you with joy while feeling focused and calm. These activities that you enjoy often lead to “flow” which occurs when you are fully focused on the task at hand in a sort of blissful immersion into your activity or hobby. When in “flow” time flies by and all that matters to you is the enjoyment you are feeling while doing something. It is important to note that passive activities (such as binging Netflix, scrolling through your phone, etc) do not induce “flow” because you are not actively taking part in the activity. There is no creativity being exercised and that does not qualify as engagement.</p>
								<h3 class="minor">Helpful Tips for College Students</h3>
								<p>Engagement for college students can take place in many different ways. Restarting an old hobby, playing an instrument, doing exercise, being involved in extracurricular activities can all induce “flow.” With the busy schedule of a college student it is important for your overall well-being to set aside time for these “flow” inducing activities. These activities could help when a friend, peer, or family member is also involved.</p>

						<!-- Relationships -->
							<article id="relation">
								<h2 class="major">Relationships</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/relation.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3 class="minor">Definition/Importance</h3>
								<p>Relationships are one of the most important aspects of living a meaningful life. Relationships do not need to be only romantic, but can be connections with family, friends, coworkers, etc. The notion that one needs to find their own path to happiness alone couldn’t be further from the truth. We are hardwired to be social animals that depend on others; we have a basic need for healthy relationships. Having positive, healthy relationships with those around you is a crucial key to happiness. In isolation it is harder to deal with pain because there aren’t others to celebrate success with, and we don’t feel as safe.</p>
								<h3 class="minor">Helpful Tips for College Students</h3>
								<p>In the COVID-19 era, this is probably the area of their life that most people took for granted. Given our socially distant context, there are a limited number of ways to really strengthen relationships with those outside of your household. Phone calls, letters, facetime (texts are not great) and socially distant activities are ways to still have these relationships in your life.</p>

						<!-- Meaning -->
							<article id="meaning">
								<h2 class="major">Meaning</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/meaning.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3 class="minor">Definition/Importance</h3>
								<p>Meaning serves the question as to “why are we put on this Earth.” People often find meaning and purpose through spirituality and religion but of course these are not the only ways to realize meaning in your life. Simply going through the motions of everyday life is not living a life of purpose. For a good amount of people, success and wealth are considered to be their meanings of life. However money is not what provides people with happiness, they are missing something else that they are trying to replace with money and/or material goods. People find meaning in life by understanding the impacts of their jobs, what tasks they enjoy doing or what they spend the most time doing.</p>
								<h3 class="minor">Helpful Tips for College Students</h3>
								<p>Trying to find meaning in college might be a difficult task because a good amount of people struggle with picking a major and/or feel a disconnect with their studies. While navigating through your college years, it is important to consider what type of life you might want to live within the next 10 years. Do you see yourself living a life of charity, a successful business person, or professional athlete? Pondering about what you might want your future to look like can serve as a template for finding meaning.</p>

						<!-- Achievement -->
							<article id="achievement">
								<h2 class="major">Achievement</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/accomplish.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3 class="minor">Definition/Importance</h3>
								<p>Achievements in our life push us to thrive and flourish. Having realistic goals (both long and short term) and ambition can provide a strong sense of satisfaction, achievement and pride once those goals are met. Achievements can take all shapes and forms and can involve personal goals, health goals, work goals, etc. The Achievements area of PERMA has the greatest effect on your well-being and your ability to thrive when those achievements are filled with meaning and the successes can be celebrated and/or shared with those around you.</p>
								<h3 class="minor">Helpful Tips for College Students</h3>
								<p>There are plenty of examples of finding achievements in your everyday life. From little victories (like getting in your work handed in on time, going to the gym or getting a certain amount of sleep, etc.) to larger ones (getting a new job, graduating, starting a new relationship, etc). Find those victories in your life and try your best to share and/or celebrate those achievements with people you are closest to (along with celebrating their achievements as well).</p>
